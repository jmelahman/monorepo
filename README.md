## Subtrees

Most projects are tracked as [git-subtrees](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt).
This allows them to be developed uniformly while leaving operational tasks, such as deployments, independent.

By design, each projects's directory (referred to as the subtree's `<prefix>`) matches the upstream repository name.
For example, `connections/` â†’ [github.com/jmelahman/connections](https://github.com/jmelahman/connections).
This is slightly more convenient to make shell functions since the `git-subtree` commands can be a bit cumbersome.

Update all upstreams with this command,

```shell
for d in */; do gsp $d; done
```
