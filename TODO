# Monorepo

pre-commit/push hooks
 - maybe should write my own shell aliases, source them in custom hooks
 - look into `just` or similar. I just want fast, convenient and diff-based.
golang tooling
fix golang linting
python testing
fix python lint noqa's
create a golang application repo template

## Agent

More tools

What workflows should it support?
 - `agent commit`, `agent commit -a`
 - `agent amend`
 - Fix failing Github actions

Openrouter integration?

## Cycle-CLI

1. Set resistance
2. Workouts
  a. Target cadence, power and
  b. Hopefully won't need an interface for creating them
  c. Import/Export
4. Statistics
  a. Cloud sync
3. Simulated routes

## Dashboard

Widgets
- docker-status
- openrouter credits
- twitter maybe?
- email
- google voice

## Docker Status

Modularize
Basic auth?

## git-orchard

- git orchard init
- git orchard status
- git orchard push/pull -a
- git orchard tag

Init should be easy and tag is the most missing feature from `git subtree`.

## go-bin

nightly nvchecker->push tag
- I'm not sure nvchecker will work since we want all versions, not just latest
figure out how to handle pypi size long-term
 - alerts? Maybe pypi provides these already

## Tag

Support tagging without a clone given a remote URL.
