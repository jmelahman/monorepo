Subcommands:
  git orchard list
  git orchard status [branch]

Include opinionated wrappers for git subtree? Such as --squash by default.

`git orchard add --existing` adds subtrees that were added via `git subtree add` (via `git log`)

---

The `git orchard list` command will:

1. **Identify all subtrees** in the current repository.
___

The `git orchard status` command will:

1. **Identify all subtrees** in the current repository.
2. **Determine the remote** each subtree is tracked from.
3. **Check the status** of the branch (typically the main branch) for each remote.
4. **Report** how many commits are behind or ahead of the current branch on the remote.


Config design:

[subtree "prefix/agent"]
  remote = git@github.com/jmelahman/agent.git
  branch = master # defaults to default branch
