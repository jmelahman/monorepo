<h1 id="using-uv-to-package-golang-applications">Using <code>uv</code>
to package Golang applications</h1>
<p>I love golang and I love uv.</p>
<p>Combining the two seems unlikely at a glance given the limited
interop between Python and Go. Moreover, the Go ecosystem is rich with
top-tier developer tools (a domain in which Go excels). To make matters
worse, Go and Python have relatively divergent core beliefs as
languages. In short, Python has core standards it upholds while allowing
downstream developers completely the freedom to create the software they
need within those standards. In contrast, Go’s core beliefs value
simplicity and maintain quality by limiting the degrees of freedom for
problems involving maintaining the language.</p>
<p>For implementing business logic, Go’s approach is fantastic. Go is
easy to learn, compile times are blazing, and feature deprecation in the
language is a non-problem. There is usually one way to do a thing and
you’re effectively guarenteed it will do it well. For packaging, on the
other hand, I find this approach a bit limiting.</p>
<p>Packaging is user-facing. Packaging effects how you solve a problem
because the problem involves end-user behavior. Those considerations
could be the difference between a user installing the application or
not.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-go-packaging">Issues with Go packaging</h2>
<p>To be fair, Go packaging is 95% complete and is really good at what
it does do. I personally have an extremely low pain tolerance for
software and an extra 100ms will bother me. Part of the issue is that I
intentionally use low-end hardware because UX and accessibility matter a
lot to me. For most use-cases, Go packaging is perfectly fine and
requires minimal effort. For me, I am willing to trade a bit of effort
for the optimal user experience; I enjoy these things. Also, this
approach is compatible with Go’s packaging which can be preferred if
desired.</p>
<p>The majority of my complaints are really just, “Go doesn’t have a
canonical package repository.”</p>

source</p></li>
<li><p>Installing Go packages requires specific versions of Go
installed</p></li>
<li><p>Managing Go packages lacks some reproducability features</p></li>
